# GAMMAFEST-2025
GammaFest 2025 challenges participants to build a machine learning model that predicts citation links between scientific papers. Using full texts, metadata, and topic labels, the goal is to help the Elbaf Library recommend relevant research. Models are evaluated using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).
